## Experiments 
Algorithm 1 in A
test_Full_SS.m      			full method for superstability, only works for 1st order system due to high complexity

Algorithm 2 in A
test_Dual_SS.m   		        dual method for superstability, greatly reduce the complexity, works for 2nd order system

section 7 in B
test_Dual_SS_all_noise.m                dual method considering all type of noises (dx, du, w), this covers test_Dual_SS.m

Algorithm 5,6,7 in B
test_Dual_QS.m                          dual method for quadratic stability, worst case H2 works while Hinf currently has bug

Algorithm 5,6,7 + section 7 in B
test_Dual_QS_all_noise.m                dual method considering all type of noises (dx, du, w), this covers test_Dual_QS.m


complexity.m                            computes the number of constraints and variables
Dual_SS_manual.m                        manually defines the multiplication in the coefficients, it is much faster than Dual_SS.m while
					currently only supports SS
